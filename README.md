# Memory Game (Java OOP Project)

## Overview
Memory Game is a classic card-matching game implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game features a graphical user interface where players flip cards to find matching pairs while tracking time.

This project was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course to demonstrate concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, interfaces, and modular design.

## OOP Concepts Used

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

- Encapsulation – each class manages its own data and behavior
- Abstraction – game logic separated into different classes
- Inheritance – structured class relationships
- Interfaces – Flippable interface for card flipping behavior
- Modularity – organized and reusable code
